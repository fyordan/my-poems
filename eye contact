I don't know why
I avoid eye
contact through my life

I sigh
as I try
to understand why

I dont see eye to eye
while I in fact don't see that
I dont see eye to eye

I might not have noticed my eyes
divert from the gaze of a sight
if I had not
  broken contact
    with the most beautiful
      eyes i have ever seen
 accidentally

...

I sigh
as I try
to understand why
I only see when it's your eyes.
