I am enjoying this
in a shallow level
from the shore I see
the horizon and fantasize
of exploring the deep blue sea

There's a depth of safety from here
There's a sense of adventure there
to sail at night guided by stars
that do not care to where I end
or if the wind steers me into storm
and at best anchor into another shore

There's not much to explore
in this shore
Or at least not anymore
I was a fool for expecting
both a sunrise and a sunset
with my feet planted on dry ground.
