5 Minutes to pack
and my favorite clothes reside in the
bottom of the laundry room floor

Hold my hand for once
something other than a chargeless phone
I cant wait to go back home
I cant wait to miss being alone

5 minutes to pack or I miss my flight
Throw everything back and
Throw away the rest

What is home other
than the clothes I chose to wear.
