These are poems.

Sorta

They suck. Most don't rhyme. Most are streams of conciousness.
I don't really want you to read them to be honest. But I want you to be able to.

I am half kidding, I would love to talk about them with someone, I just don't
want anyone asking me.. "Hey this poem sounds sad, are you okay?" Because the
best poems and songs in the world are actually pretty depressing, and no one
is asking John Mayer if he is okay after he gets paid millions of dollars to
sing about a daily life for the average joe.

Poems in txt are fairly new and idk where to take them. Poems in pdf
are more well fleshed out and I have submitted them for different reasons.
