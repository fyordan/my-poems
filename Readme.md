## These are poems.

Sorta

They suck. Most don't rhyme. Most are streams of conciousness.
I don't really want you to read them to be honest. But I want you to be able to.

I am half kidding, I would love to talk about them with someone, I just don't
want anyone asking me.. "Hey this poem sounds sad, are you okay?" Because the
best poems and songs in the world are actually pretty depressing, and no one
is asking John Mayer if he is okay after he gets paid millions of dollars to
sing about a daily life for the average joe.

Poems in txt are fairly new and idk where to take them. Poems in pdf
are more well fleshed out and I have submitted them for different reasons.


## FAQ:

#### Seriously dude, some of these poems are ... weird.
That's not a question.

#### Is this poem about ... (insert a specific person here)?
I'll never admit it so it doesn't matter.

#### Did you know your grammar is incorrect in some of these?
Yes. Some are stream of conciousness so I didn't really bother much with grammar.
Others are on purpose, cause it adds weird ambiguity or changes the meaning.
Sometimes I just like incorrect grammar cause it sounds more interesting.

#### Which ones of these are you most proud of.
`Sonder` and `Elemental Sestina of Your Name` are probably the two I took
most seriously. Both in `Call these poems art`. Actually, I am in general
pretty proud of that book. But there's a lot of depressing or hostile poems there.

In terms of technically challenging poems I would have to say:
`Words Written in your eyes` (visual poem)
`Adios/Goodbye` (technically 2 poems that combine to make a 3)
`poem.py` (oh python)

#### Why are you uploading these?
I want to get better at writing. And right now I am too scared to show my work
to friends. It's a step to get more comfortable.
