I stay afloat
through clever rhetorical tricks
and word manipulation to not say
what I want to say
to give you a way
out to give you a way out
and to give me
a way out

Cause I need air to breathe
and you need air untouched
by me
Because I'll drag you down
from Flamenco beach to the Puerto Rico Trench
from a cover picture tropical paradise
to an enigma deep underneath survivable pressure

...

And I don't want that
Who would want that

So with an empty crew I guarantee my future shipwreck.
