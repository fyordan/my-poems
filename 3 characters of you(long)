The strong and independent character.
You want something and you know you can get it.
It's not that you think you deserve it or that it will be easy,
but you are capable and truly aware of your limitations.
It just is that you know your limitations can be pushed further.

The free spirited, life loving, fun character.
You know life is for the living. And living is worth living for.
You know how to have fun, and it's contagious.
The people you love have no choice but to love life, because who wouldn't
love life with you.

The plot twist character.
I leave this state blank. This is the wild card, like you.
I can't possibly summarize your character as 3 archetypes,
because everytime I see you is meeting you again. There's a story arc
that you are following and you are your own master. I can't tell who you are,
but wow do I want to find out with you.
