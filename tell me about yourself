So please tell me a bit about yourself?

About what?

What do I do?
I overanalyze every little aspect of everything
yet somehow miss out on all the details.
I program, but you knew that, I am applying for SWE after-all.

What do I like to do?
I like to blast music at dangerous levels while I bike downhill
at dangerous speeds
I like to think I am in a music video
and humorize my illusions of grandeur
because I am entitled to my dreams but I know I don't deserve them anymore
than anyone else.
I like to pretend that I am going to change the world,
for the better
and still become rich.
I like to play video games and watch tv and read about aventures that I
will never see from the comfort of my AC cubicle.
I like streams of conciousness, writing and publishing and never revisiting
for a second draft ... 
because I've had this though process before and I thought it was clever,
but i'd rather leave my conciousness behind and actually get stuff done.

There's not much about me other than an endless stream of conciousness,
so enjoy me while I warm up to you and keep my mouth shut, cause there's
no turning back when a conversation opens up these floodgates. 

But notice that I have only answered what I like to do and what I do.
Because who am I?

If I knew the answer to that question I wouldn't be here would I?
Does anyone really know who they are and what they want? Maybe ...
but I assure you I wouldn't be begging for a job if I was in that state.
