I write for an audience of none

Part of me thinks no one is listening
Part of me thinks everyone is

Narcissistic me wants you to read
and find Narcissistic you in my lines
Narcissistic me wants you to think
im deep LOL

Shy me is terrified you find you in my lines
Shy me is terrified you find me in my lines
Shy me is terrified you think everything has
a deeper meaning than "this is just art"
I am terrified you learn to distinguish between
my act, my art, and everything else.

I am terrified you figure out me.
Good thing this is for an audience of none ...

I owe you a drink if you figure this out.
